# Create an Azure account

If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website to start exploring at no cost to you. Once you're ready, you can choose to upgrade and start paying for the Azure services you use above the free amounts. MBWAY generated cards could be an option for example.

## What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. This is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore. To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account. Credit card information is used for identity verification only. You won't be charged for any services until you upgrade.

## Exercise - Create an Azure account

To create and use Azure services, you first need to sign up. If youâ€™ve never tried or paid for Azure before, you can sign up for the Azure free account.

You'll need a valid credit card to create your Azure free account. This card is used for identity validation only. Your card won't be charged until you choose to upgrade.


### Sign up for a free account

1. In a web browser, go to https://azure.microsoft.com/free.

2. Scroll down through the page to learn more about the benefits and free services available.

3. Select Start free.

4. Sign in with your Microsoft or GitHub account or create a free Microsoft account.

5. On the About you page, select your correct country or region. Enter your first and last name, email address, and phone number. 

6. On the Identity verification by phone screen, type the number of a telephone to which you have immediate access.

7. You have the option of text or callback to obtain a verification code. Select the relevant button, type the code in the Verification code box, and select Verify code.

8. If the verification code is correct, you're asked to enter details of a valid credit card. Enter the card information and select Next.

9. The last step is to review the agreement and privacy statement then select Sign up.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a free account, and should be on the Azure portal home page at https://portal.azure.com/
