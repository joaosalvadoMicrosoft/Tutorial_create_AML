# Tutorial to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace on Azure and use notebooks

In this tutorial we will create an Azure Machine Learning(AML) workspace on Azure and we will explore how to access the workspace and make use of the notebooks

## Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.
You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.

AML is an Enterprise-grade machine learning service for building and deploying models faster and it empowers developers and data scientists with a wide range of productive experiences for building, training and deploying machine learning models faster. Accelerate time to market and foster team collaboration with industry-leading MLOps and DevOps for machine learning. Innovate on a secure, trusted platform, designed for responsible AI.

In this workshop we will go step by step on how to first create an Azure subscription, then creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace on that Azure subscription and then finally access a Notebook to develop a Data Science project.  

Please follow the steps on the Hands on Labs.


# Hands on Labs 

[1. Create an Azure account](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_create_AML/tree/master/1.%20Create%20an%20Azure%20account/README.md) 

[2. Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_create_AML/tree/master/2.%20Create%20an%20Azure%20Machine%20Learning%20workspace/README.md) 

[3. Access the notebooks](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_create_AML/blob/master/3.%20Access%20the%20notebooks/README.md)
